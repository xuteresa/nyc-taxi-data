# Title: NYC Yellow Taxi Data

## Summary
* Research Questions:
  * What are the most significant predictors for a taxi driver to maxizime their revenue eraned per distance traveled? 
  
In this report, we will compare the relationship between revenue and the following independent variables 
* Pickup Location
* Dropoff Location
* Passenger number
* Rate ID
* Time of Day
* Day of Week

Our Hypotheses are:
* H1: Rides starting in midtown would yield the most revenue
* H2: Rate Code (e.g. trips to airport) would be the strongest determinant in revenue generation
* H3: Weekday rush hour trips (7-10am and 4-7pm) would generate more revenue than weekend rides and non-rush hour trips
* H4: Higher passenger counts would yield higher revenue than low passenger count rides

We plan to examine what trip data says about areas in New York, and come up with recommendations for taxi drivers to get the most out of their time on the road.
